    <h1>Grill Cheese </h1>
    <p>These crustless grilled cheese sandwiches are great to have stashed in the freezer for when the kids need a quick snack.
         Easy for little hands to hold, with the cheese sealed inside and no tough crusts, they're fun
         for them and convenient for you. You will need a sandwich sealer for this recipe, and they are easy to find online.</p>
